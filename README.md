## Repository Structure

### 1. [ARDUINO CODES/](./ARDUINO%20CODES)

This folder contains the Arduino source code used to program the maze-solving robot.

- **How to Use:**
  - Open the `.ino` files in [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (version 2.3.2 or later recommended).
  - Follow the comments in the code to understand how the maze-solving logic is implemented.
  - Upload the code to your ESP32-S3 microcontroller to test the robot's functionality.

### 2. [PCB Design/](./PCB%20Design)

This folder contains the design files for the robot's custom PCB.

- **How to Use:**
  - Files are in formats compatible with **Altium Designer**.
  - Use these files to review the schematic, layout, and routing of the PCB.
  - If you plan to modify the PCB, make sure you have experience with PCB design software.

### 3. [Proposal/](./Proposal)

This folder contains the project proposal documents.

- **How to Use:**
  - Review the proposal to understand the project's objectives, methodology, and outcomes.
  - Documents may be in `.pdf` or `.docx` format.
